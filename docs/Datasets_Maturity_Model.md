- A **Product** maturity model
- Measured by **Level of FAIRness** achieved for a given dataset to fulfill a given usage
<br>i.e. we will NOT use 'FAIR maturity levels' but instead use 'Level of FAIRness'
- Formed of Data Usability Scenarios
<br>Each usability scenario describes the Metadata required to fulfill the usability scenario & the capabilities expected for the data environment to exhibit

## FAIRness Level of Data Sets: Value-based FAIR Data Assessment

This section provides methods and guidance for measuring FAIRness levels of data sets with an ultimate goal of creating a value.

### What is **Level of FAIRness** ?

-   Level of FAIRness measures the conformance of data objects to the FAIR principles.
    
-   The conformance is measured by set of indicators

Please see : 

 [RDA Indicators](docs/RDA_Indicators.md)

 [FAIR+ Indicators](docs/FAIR+Indicators.md)
    
-   Indicators indicates maturity of data set corresponding to four letters of FAIR and Data Usage Areas

### Data Usage Areas

Each organization or research community might have different business goals for re-using data. These different re-use areas require different attention for improving findability, accessibility and interoperability of data sets. Following table provides an overview of these data re-use areas, what needs to be improved in data management processes and potential benefits.



|Data Usage Area                |Aim |Expected Benefit|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Data Interoperability |Improve reuse of data by another person.<br>-   Provide metadata about how data is organized and structured.<br>-   Document the content of data files, and their relations.<br>  -   Identify and validate data types and formats           |- Reduces time spent for each person examining and understanding existing research data.            |
|Data Integration|Improve data consolidation & harmonization.<br>-   Annotate data with common vocabularies, ontologies.  <br>-   Use of common master data and reference data.<br>-   Use common data profiles, models, schemas for semantic modelling.<br>-   Improve interoperability by mapping terminologies.           |- Reduces time for data cleaning and integration.<br>- Increases the likelihood of linking datasets with other sets automatically.            |
|Data Repurposing |Improve reuse of data in another context, such as with different research hypotheses.<br>-   Document research hypothesis and data inclusion and exclusion criteria  <br>-   Document reference materials, such as cell lines and microorganisms. <br>-   Document different steps of research lifecycle and their data outputs.<br>-   Provide raw data or primary data, not only derived and analyzed data sets.<br>-   Provide a variety of research outcomes, such as negative results.|- Reduces the resources spent for generating data for research hypotheses.<br>- Improves repurposing of data as part of a new study.|
|Data Reproducibility|Improve repeatability, replicability, reproducibility of research outcomes<br>-   Provide documentation and guidelines for describing research protocols.<br>-   Provide provenance of experiment such as measuring tools, locations, conditions, hypothesis, time periods.<br>-   Identify the key resources such as antibodies, model organisms and software.<br>-   Share materials, software, and other tools used for data analysis|- Ensures transparency, gives confidence in understanding study.<br>- Increases the likelihood of attaining results by a different or same research team, using the same or different experiment setups.|



Potential future Data Usage areas:

-   Regulatory Reporting: Easily fulfill the mandatory reporting requirements
    
-   Data Analytics (machine actionable data): Easy access by services and running algorithms and computational models
