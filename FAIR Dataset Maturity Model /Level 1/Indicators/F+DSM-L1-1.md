# ID: F+L1-1

### Maturity Indicator Name: Each study variable is reported in a single dataset field

### The FAIR principle it applies to: F2

### What is being measured: Structural consistency of a dataset. This indicator tests if the each study variable is reported in an unambiguous single dataset field. 

### Why it should be measured: Structured data is inherently easier for machines to accurately process and interpret. This is an essential precondition to enhance and improve subsequent annotation of data with metadata. This requirement guards against some of the common problems with messy datasets, such as 1)  multiple variables being reported in one field and 2) field names (column headers) are values, not variable names.

### What must be provided for the measurement?
### How is the measurement executed?
### What is/are considered valid result(s)?
