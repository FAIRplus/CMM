# Dataset Maturity Level 1

Level one focuses on the structure of a single dataset. 

Establishing a Tidy Dataset structure puts a dataset into the entry level of maturity. The simple semantics of Tidy dataset prescribes that fields should represent measured variables in the dataset, while rows/records  should represent instances of observations being measured against the set of attributes denoted by these variables.

### Requirements
- Each field in the dataset describes a study variable
- Each value is a single measurement 
- Each record/row in the dataset contains all values measured on the same entity (e.g. subject, sample, observed feature, study) across variables. 
- Every type of observation unit forms a dataset
