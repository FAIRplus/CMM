# Dataset Maturity Level 2


Level two builds up on level one to establish domain-specific semantics to a dataset. This level focuses on creating Typed Datasets. A dataset type is defined by the master data entity that the dataset reports data about. In FAIRplus we focus on the biomedical research domain and thus dataset types defined are reflective of the master data entities that are common in this domain such as, subject, biospecimen, bioassay, study, and observation.
