# Subject Dataset Type

A Subject dataset type descriptor describes a class of datasets the subject matter of which are the subjects recruited in a study. It includes data that describe each subject across a study as whole. For example, subject demographics and other characteristics that could be of importance for the study data interpretation. Also data that associates subjects to the different study design elements such as different cohorts (treatment groups), study visits and locations. Datasets described by instances of this meta-descriptor are usually linked to all other subject-related datasets via a "SubjectIdentifier" field that references the key identifier field in this dataset.
