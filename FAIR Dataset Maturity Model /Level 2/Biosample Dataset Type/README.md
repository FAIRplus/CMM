A Bio-sample Dataset descriptor is a metamodel each instance of which is a dataset
model for describing bio-samples that are part of a study and their characteristics.
Unlike the subject dataset, a sample dataset might be generated for each molecular
assay performed in the study. Similar to all other dataset meta-descriptors in this
level, it prescribes all necessary and expected data elements that describe a sample,
its characteristics and its association with overall study design elements or protocols conducted as part of processing the biosamples.
