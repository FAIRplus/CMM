# FAIR Data Capability Maturity Model (CMM)

  

### What is a CMM?

Maturity models typically include a sequence of levels that form an anticipated, desired, or logical path from an initial immature or incomplete state to a fully fledged maturity state.

An organization’s current maturity level in a domain represents its capabilities as regards a specific class of objects and application domain

  
  

### Why do we need a CMM for FAIR Data ?

-   FAIR data principles describe desired features of digital objects and FAIR indicators provide methods to assess the compliance of data sets to FAIR principles.
    
-   FAIR is a journey rather than a state. Therefore, there is a need for a discipline specific guidance for FAIR maturation.
    
-   Each organization has different business goals. Their data sharing and reuse policies should be aligned with value generation targets.
    
-   FAIR data should be part of organizations’ data life cycle. Effective FAIR data generation and reuse requires maturation in organizational processes, technological infrastructure, policies and skills.
    

  
### How FAIR Data CMM works?

  

FAIR Data CMM provides a toolbox to measure fitness of data for targeted business goals, and required capabilities to support FAIR data management processes.

FAIR Data CMM provides two distinct but related maturity models:

1)  FAIR Dataset Maturity Model: to assess the FAIRness level of specific data sets for identified business goals.

2)  FAIR Data Management Capability Maturity Model: to Assess the maturity level of FAIR data related processes in an organization, and provide guidance for achieving the desired state of maturation. Maturation in capabilities supports the increase in FAIRness level of datasets in alignment with each organization's business goals.

  
  

## Section A: FAIRness level of Data Sets: Value-based FAIR Data Assessment

This section provides methods and guidance for measuring FAIRness levels of data sets with an ultimate goal of creating a value.

What is the **level of FAIRness** ?

-   Level of FAIRness measures the conformance of data objects to the FAIR principles.
    
-   The conformance is measured by set of indicators

 [RDA Indicators](docs/RDA_Indicators.md)

 [FAIR+ Indicators](docs/FAIR+Indicators.md)
    
-   Indicators indicates maturity of data set corresponding to four letters of FAIR and Data Usage Areas

### Data Usage Areas

Each organization or research community might have different business goals for re-using data. These different re-use areas require different attention for improving findability, accessibility and interoperability of data sets. Following table provides an overview of these data re-use areas, what needs to be improved in data management processes and potential benefits.



|Data Usage Area                |Aim |Expected Benefit|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Data Interoperability |Improve reuse of data by another person.<br>-   Provide metadata about how data is organized and structured.<br>-   Document the content of data files, and their relations.<br>  -   Identify and validate data types and formats           |- Reduces time spent for each person examining and understanding existing research data.            |
|Data Integration|Improve data consolidation & harmonization.<br>-   Annotate data with common vocabularies, ontologies.  <br>-   Use of common master data and reference data.<br>-   Use common data profiles, models, schemas for semantic modelling.<br>-   Improve interoperability by mapping terminologies.           |- Reduces time for data cleaning and integration.<br>- Increases the likelihood of linking datasets with other sets automatically.            |
|Data Repurposing |Improve reuse of data in another context, such as with different research hypotheses.<br>-   Document research hypothesis and data inclusion and exclusion criteria  <br>-   Document reference materials, such as cell lines and microorganisms. <br>-   Document different steps of research lifecycle and their data outputs.<br>-   Provide raw data or primary data, not only derived and analyzed data sets.<br>-   Provide a variety of research outcomes, such as negative results.|- Reduces the resources spent for generating data for research hypotheses.<br>- Improves repurposing of data as part of a new study.|
|Data Reproducibility|Improve repeatability, replicability, reproducibility of research outcomes<br>-   Provide documentation and guidelines for describing research protocols.<br>-   Provide provenance of experiment such as measuring tools, locations, conditions, hypothesis, time periods.<br>-   Identify the key resources such as antibodies, model organisms and software.<br>-   Share materials, software, and other tools used for data analysis|- Ensures transparency, gives confidence in understanding study.<br>- Increases the likelihood of attaining results by a different or same research team, using the same or different experiment setups.|



Potential future DU areas:

-   Regulatory Reporting: Easily fulfill the mandatory reporting requirements
    
-   Data Analytics (machine actionable data): Easy access by services and running algorithms and computational models
