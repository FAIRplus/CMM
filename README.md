# FAIR Data Capability Maturity Model (CMM)

  

### What is a CMM?

Maturity models typically include a sequence of levels that form an anticipated, desired, or logical path from an initial immature or incomplete state to a fully fledged maturity state.

An organization’s current maturity level in a domain represents its capabilities as regards a specific class of objects and application domain

  
  

### Why do we need a CMM for FAIR Data ?

-   FAIR data principles describe desired features of digital objects and FAIR indicators provide methods to assess the compliance of data sets to FAIR principles.
    
-   FAIR is a journey rather than a state. Therefore, there is a need for a discipline specific guidance for FAIR maturation.
    
-   Each organization has different business goals. Their data sharing and reuse policies should be aligned with value generation targets.
    
-   FAIR data should be part of organizations’ data life cycle. Effective FAIR data generation and reuse requires maturation in organizational processes, technological infrastructure, policies and skills.
    

  
### How FAIR Data CMM works?

 :wrench: FAIR Data CMM provides a toolbox to measure fitness of data for targeted business goals, and required capabilities to support FAIR data management processes.

FAIR Data CMM provides two distinct but related maturity models:

1)  [FAIR Dataset Maturity Model](docs/Datasets_Maturity_Model.md)

	To assess the FAIRness level of specific data sets for identified business goals.

2) [FAIR Data Management Capability Maturity Model](docs/Data_Management_Maturity_Model.md)

	To assess the maturity level of FAIR data related processes in an organization, and provide guidance for achieving the desired state of maturation. Maturation in capabilities supports the increase in FAIRness level of datasets in alignment with each organization's business goals.
